#+TITLE: Pseudocode

anyime there is a move, generate a random tile on the x and y axis that is not occiupied
- generate, if occupied, generate again

when there is a move (eg left), move the left most tile left until it can't move anymore then move the one to the right of that all the way left, and so on. Then move down one row and repeat.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
if (board[0][1] != 0 and board[0][0] == 0):
    board[0][0] = board[0][1]
    board [0][1] = 0

# Then move one to the right and go again
if (board[0][2] != 0 and board[0][1] == 0):
    board[0][1] = board [0][2]
    board [0][2] = 0

# and again until it reaches the end of the line then move down one row and try again
if (board[1][1] != 0 and board[1][0] == 0):
    board[1][0] = board[1][1]
    board[1][1] = 0

# and continue down the row then go down one again --> First move in the x axis then move in the y axis and try to avoid out of bounds errors

#+END_SRC

if two tiles touch, check if they are the same number then make the one in the direction of movement the double number
